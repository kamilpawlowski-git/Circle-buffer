# Description
Circle buffer is commonly used in embedded programming when efficient memory management is highly required.

My cirlce buffer breaks the rules a little bit because it works on pointers (not on classic array where data is extracted by indexing). It was done purposely to do something different and show that pointers do not have to be scary :) 

To work with all types of data code is templated.

Source code and includes are in the same directory due to small size of the project.
